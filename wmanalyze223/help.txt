   Important - Instruction for execution
  ---------------------------------------
  
  To install:
  1. Unzip WmAnalyzer*.zip into an empty directory. It will create the following
     structure:
     
     |-- db (dir)
     |   |-- wmanalyzer.tmp (empty dir)
     |   |-- wmanalyzer.properties (file)
     |   |-- wmanalyzer.script (file)
     |
     |-- template (dir)
     |   |-- project.mpp (file) 
     |   |-- report.xls (file)
     |
     |-- help.txt (file)
     |-- log4j.properties (file)
     |-- project.properties (file)
     |-- start_analyzer.bat (file)
     |-- start_analyzer.sh (file)
     |-- wmanalyzer.jar (file)
     |-- db-clean.zip (file)
     |-- clean_hsqldb.sh (file)

  2. Copy all package directories or package archives to a temporary location.
     You do not have to extract the archived packages. You can assign multiple
     package directories.
  3. Edit the project.properties file to configure the runtime (see below). 
  4. Start the analyzer using the start_analyzer script. Please read the log 
     output before closing the command prompt window.
     The database is started automatically within the application.
  5. In the report directory, the output is placed in an Excel workbook.
     Note: when you open the report for the first time, it may take a few
           moments to complete all calculations and update all cells.
  6. In the template directory, you'll find a sample project plan. You can use
     the values of the first sheet of the workbook to fill the GREEN fields
  
  Do NOT run the analysis directly onto the original source code!
